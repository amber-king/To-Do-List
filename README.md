# To-Do-List

This is my first attempt at a Python-like frontend using `tkinter`. This application allows you to add tasks to a to-do list, see your task list updated, and delete tasks once they are done. The GUI is designed with a neutral themed color to minimize eye strain.

* Add a task to the to-do list
* See your task list updated
* Delete a task once it is done

## Technologies

* `tkinter`: A GUI toolkit for Python

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. Install Python and `tkinter` on your computer.
2. Download the source code of the application from GitHub.
3. Run the `to_do_list_fe.py` file to start the application.

## Usage

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Add Task" button to add a task to the to-do list.
2. Type the task in the text box and click the "Add Task" button.
3. See your task list updated with the new task.
4. Click the "Remove Task" button to delete a task once it is done.
5. Select the task from the list and click the "Remove Task" button.
6. The selected task will be deleted from the list.
